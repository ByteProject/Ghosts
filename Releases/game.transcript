Great Hall
Flames dance in the fireplace and wood crackles as it burns slowly, giving off a
pleasant warmth. Flickering light wanders across the walls, engulfing the
shadows and illuminating the room in a melancholy twilight. In one corner, just
below the portraits of the ancestors, stands a beautifully decorated Christmas
tree. Through the large windows you can see a snowstorm raging, the wind is
howling as waves of snowflakes streak by. The only exit is to the north, leading
to the vestibule.

>north

Vestibule
The room is dimly lit by bulbs in sconces, casting long shadows across the cold
floor. To the west, you can see an enormous wooden door leading to the outside,
its surface polished by centuries of use. The library lies to the north, the
great hall to the south and the kitchen to the east. To the southwest, you
notice an old hinged door. A stone staircase spirals upwards.

Rosie is here. It seems as if she has been waiting for you.

>talk to rosie
You: "Hey Rosie, how are the preparations going?"
Rosie: "I am finished now, Sir Thomas. The manor is cleaned, I've made bread and
biscuits for you and Lady Cora and the fridge is stocked with fresh vegetables
and meat. It will be a lovely Christmas."

You: "Is Cora back?"
Rosie: "The Lady has not yet returned from her visit to town. She wanted to buy
a few things and come back in the afternoon, so she should be home soon."

You: "I hope you enjoy your time off."
Rosie: "We are going to take it easy, just like every year. That's what I love
about Christmas. The world slows down a bit and you reflect on the essentials.
I'll be back for you and the Lady in the new year."

You: "It's quite a heavy snowstorm out there. Can you make it home?"
Rosie: "No worries, Sir Thomas. As you know, our house belongs to the manor.
It's only a ten minute walk. It'll be fine."

You: "Thank you, Rosie. A merry Christmas for you and your loved ones. Since
Blackwood is new to us, may I call you in case we have a question?"
Rosie: "Of course, Sir Thomas! I left you my number in the kitchen."

Rosie waves goodbye and leaves the manor.

It will probably take a while for Cora to get back from the city. You wonder how
you are going to pass the time until she returns, which reminds you that you
wanted to check out the lounge.

The Gallery
A multitude of beautiful oil paintings graces the walls, a glimpse of forgotten
times. You can feel the soft, plush fibres of the carpet runner under your feet.
To the north, an old wooden door leads to the lounge. To the south, you get to
the Solar. The bathroom is to the northwest. A spiral stone staircase leads
down.

>north

Lounge
The decor of the lounge is traditional, perfect for cozying up with a good book
or a glass of whisky. Several vinyl records are scattered around the stereo
system. On the opposite side of the room, you see a large TV with a VHS system
and video tapes stacked neatly nearby. A grandfather clock breaks the silence
with its ticks. An exit to the south leads back to the gallery.

>take vinyl
(in order to listen to music)
You decide to play "No Rest for the Wicked" by New Model Army, one of your
favourite records. You sit down in one of the armchairs and close your eyes. The
ethereal guitars with heavy chorus effects gently lull you to sleep. Further and
further you are carried away, back to a life lived long ago.

You see the world with different eyes now. Not your eyes. Hastily you move
through a garden that you somehow know. It is summer, and the scent of wild
flowers fills the air. You walk purposefully towards a tower-like building,
driven by one of the strongest emotions, fear.

Inside, it takes a moment for your eyes, or rather the eyes through which you
see, to adjust to the changed lighting conditions. Somehow the place seems
historic, as if you have travelled back hundreds of years in time. You gaze up
and see numerous birds lurking in holes in the walls. Then you look down and
notice strange hands burying something. You can't make out what it is, but on
the back of the hand, which is definitely not yours, you recognise a large and
very distinctive scar.

Before you can make out any more details, something pulls you back into your
body. As you open your eyes, you feel the warm morning sun shining in your face
through the leaded window. Obviously Cora didn't want to wake you last night and
covered you with a warm blanket instead.

What a strange dream it was. A mysterious place that seemed somehow familiar,
the fear, the unknown object being buried, the scar. You have to catch up with
Cora. She's probably still asleep in the solar, or already making breakfast.

The Solar
In one corner of the grand chamber is a large four-poster bed with heavy velvet
curtains drawn around it. Next to the bed is a small bedside table with an oil
lamp. There are also a few modern items scattered around. A rotary telephone
sits on a small table beside the bed, and a portable television with rabbit-ear
antennas stands on a low shelf in the corner. A window lets you look far across
the manor lands. Doors lead east and north.

Cora has snuggled up in bed and is reading a book.

>talk to cora
You: "Good morning, darling! I hope you slept well. How was the shopping?"
Cora: "Hi, honey! I don't think I've ever slept better. This bed is so
incredibly comfortable. I probably bought too much stuff though. And Inverness
hasn't changed at all."

You: "Did you enjoy being home again?"
Cora: "You know I haven't been there since Mum died in 1975. It felt so strange
to be walking these streets after more than eleven years. I'll probably get used
to it again."

You: "Would you like some breakfast?"
Cora: "Thank you, sweetie. I am not hungry. I had a coffee and now all I need to
be happy is this bed and this book."

You: "What are you reading?"
Cora: "Well, I found this book about the Scottish witch hunts lying around.
Pretty morbid, isn't it?"

You: "I had a strange dream tonight. There was a building with holes in the
walls where birds were nesting."
Cora: "Sounds like an old dovecote. You know we have one on the manor grounds,
don't you?"

You've run out of topics to talk about and end the conversation.

Forecourt
The forecourt is surrounded by a dry stone wall. You hear the sound of a nearby
stream as it meanders through the snowy, lush landscape of the surrounding
forest. Walls of rough-hewn stone loom before you, covered with moss and ivy
with a massive wooden door with iron hinges to the east set into it. Nearby, a
weathered stone bench overlooks a small pond with a stone bridge, leading
northeast to a feral garden. The air is cool and damp.

Cora's car, a 1980 Vauxhall Astra, is parked here.

>open car
You search the car and notice your folding spade is in the trunk. You already
wondered where it might be. Seems like Cora borrowed it when she bought the
Christmas tree.

>take spade
You take the folding spade with you.

Feral Garden
You're' admidst barren, snow-covered thornbushes and frost-covered grass. Vines
and thorny brambles creep up the walls of the manor. To the west is an old
dovecote, its structure weathered but still standing. A trail northwards leads
into the forest, disappearing into the shadows of the trees. You can hear the
crunch of snow under your feet and the distant wail of the wind. The scent of
the winter air fills your senses with the crisp, refreshing aroma of the season.
A cobbled path leads southwest.

>w

Dovecote
The dovecote has been repurposed as a garden shed. The inside is cluttered with
garden tools, bags of soil and pots of various sizes. You can see that the
nesting holes have been blocked off, but the faint scent of bird droppings still
lingers in the air. A door to the east leads back to the garden.

You have no idea how this can be but you recognise the dovecote from your dream,
even though it looked different. You notice the spot where something has been
buried.

>dig spot with spade
You dig at the spot with the folding spade and after a little while you find a
leather pouch.

>take pouch then open it
You take the leather pouch with you.

You open the leather pouch, revealing a mysterious golden key. A thought occurs
to you. Something was indeed buried in the dovecote. That means the man with the
scar must be real. You should consult someone who knows more about the manor.

>take key
You take the golden key out.

>examine key
A golden key, richly decorated with Christian symbolism. Definitely medieval.
There is an inscription on it: "The holy Pearl of Scotland holds the key."

the kitchen, while electric lights brighten the room. There are exits to the
north, south, east and west.

One can only admire this craftsmanship. You wonder how old these worktops are,
probably many centuries.

Rosie seems to have left a note for you on one of the worktops.

This is a very old British bakelite telephone, probably from the 1940s. You
wouldn't expect anything less in Blackwood. It seems that every piece in the
manor has a story to tell.

Use it with [call person].

[Note: There are a some not-so-obvious call recipients available for your
amusement. Calling these does not affect the story nor grant you points. Some
make sense in the context of this game. Can you find out who it is? For one call
recipient, you might need to be a fan of a certain album called "Ride the
Lightning".]

>call rosie
You call Rosie. It seems as if the dial tone rings for an eternity but then she
picks up the phone.

You: Hey Rosie! I'm sorry to bother you. I have a question, and it may seem a
little strange. Can you think of anything in relation to Blackwood about a man
with a scar on his hand?

Rosie: That's indeed a strange question, Sir Thomas. However, I think you should
have a look at the portraits of the ancestors. You may be interested in the
painting of Lord Archibald Bain. The people here believe that he was not a good
man. They claim he wiped out an entire village during the great Scottish witch
hunts and was even responsible for the disappearance of some children in the
manor's parish. Probably just old wives' tales, but there is a grain of truth in
every tale they say.

You: Indeed doesn't sound like a very pleasant fellow. Thank you Rosie, I'll
have a look.

You end the conversation.

below the portraits of the ancestors, stands a beautifully decorated Christmas
tree. Through the large windows you can see the manor's feral garden and the
surrounding forest blanketed in a white layer. The only exit is to the north,
leading to the vestibule.

>examine portraits
Fascinated, you look at the many portraits of the former Lords and Ladies of
Blackwood. There must be some clues in the manor's library to find out who they
depict. Judging by their clothes, however, they are all long gone. The way of
all flesh.

On closer inspection, you can see the portrait Rosie was talking about. Lord
Bain's cold gaze is hard to resist. An icy shiver runs down your spine. Bain is
holding a hand to his chest, and on the back of his hand you recognise the same
distinctive scar you saw in your dream. How can this be?

>examine portrait
You wonder if what they say about him is true. Did he really wipe out an entire
village because its inhabitants had allegedly made a pact with the devil? So
much bloodshed, all in the name of God?

>search portrait
You turn the portrait and on the back you notice a small elevation under the
canvas as if there is something hidden underneath. You cannot open the canvas
with your bare hands though. You need something like a small and very sharp
knife or a cutter to not destroy the picture.

>x canvas
You wonder what is hidden underneath.

Storeroom
The dim light can barely illuminate the room. In front of you is a large chest
of drawers with a mirror on top. The drawers are closed, but you can see that
they're labelled with various items such as "linen", "candles" and "cutlery". On
the floor you can spot a dusty typewriter. On the right, there's a metal shelf
with various cleaning supplies. Above the shelf is a row of coat hangers with
some old jackets and hats. You can leave by heading south.

>examine jackets
The old jackets are quite moth-eaten and definitely no longer suitable for
wearing.

>search jackets
Oh, there's an electric torch in one of the pockets that might come in handy.

>take torch then examine it
You take the electric torch with you.

It's an Ever Ready electric torch, probably from the 1970s, currently off.

One of the paintings stands out. The portrait of the man with the scar on his

>cut canvas with cutter
You carefully cut the canvas next to the elevation without destroying the
picture. A parchment falls from the portrait.

>get parchment then read it
You take the parchment with you.

The writing is ornate and looks old-fashioned. There is a kind of riddle on the
parchment: Behind the endless knot I was laid to rest. Four, four, two, three,
find me and you will see.

Bathroom
The bathroom is illuminated by a crystal chandelier, casting a warm and inviting
glow on the marble floors and walls. In the centre of the room is a luxurious
claw-foot bathtub with shiny silver taps. In the corner is a sleek, modern
toilet with a streamlined design. A stunning Celtic knot is carved into a stone
that's embedded in the wall above the bathtub. A door to the south leads back to
the gallery.

>examine knot
With amazement you admire the work of art perpetuated in the stone. It is
certainly a lot older than the rest of the bathroom. Celtic knots, in Scottish
Gaelic "snaidhm Ceilteach", are loops that have no beginning or end, symbolising
infinity. They are known for their adaption for use in the ornamentation of
early Christian monuments and manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, a
book produced around the years 715-720 in the monastery at Lindisfarne, off the
coast of the Kingdom of Northumbria. In this context it makes sense to find
Insular art here, as it likely dates back to the time when Blackwood was a
monastery. Under the knot there are four garnets set into the stone.

>examine garnets
The use of garnets as gemstones has been common since the Bronze Age. Garnets
and other heavy minerals occur in many of the sedimentary beds of the North of
England and Scotland. So it is not surprising to find them here alongside this
wonderful Celtic knot.

>push garnets
You need to be more precise on this one [push garnets in order 1234].

>read parchment
The writing is ornate and looks old-fashioned. There is a kind of riddle on the
parchment: Behind the endless knot I was laid to rest. Four, four, two, three,
find me and you will see.

>push garnets in order 4423
You can hear the sound of an ancient mechanism being activated behind the wall.
Part of the Celtic knot opens to reveal a bronze statuette lying in a dusty
niche behind it.

>take statuette then examine it
As soon as you move the bronze statuette, the mechanism activates and hides the
niche behind the knot again. But you were quick enough to pull out the statuette
which is now in your possession.

You admire an angel blowing a horn. Could it be the Archangel Gabriel announcing
Judgement day? Anyway, the statuette looks like it is part of something. The
challenge will be finding that something.

The Chapel
Rows of pews stretch out before you. The occasional creak of old wood can be
heard. An ancient altar is the centrepiece of the chapel, drawing your eyes to
it with its grandeur and attention to detail. Behind it, you see niches with
stained glass windows. One wonders how many prayers and moments of reflection
the chapel has witnessed over the centuries. Doors lead to the south, the
southwest and to the north.

>sw

Oratory
A stained glass window depicts a scene of a noble woman washing the feet of the
poor, with vibrant colours streaming in through the panes and casting colourful
shadows across the room. An exit lies to the north.

An alcove to the left catches the eye with a beautifully carved statue of a
saint, surrounded by a small collection of dried flowers. The saint is depicted
with a serene expression, her hands directed hopefully towards the heavens.

>examine statue
A small plaque beside the statue reads "Saint Margaret of Scotland."

>examine hands
The way the hands are held suggests that you can place something into them.

>put key in hands
The key fits perfectly. A stone in the wall slides aside and reveals a set of
silver plates. It's kind of mysterious. Under normal circumstances, you would
never have found them. Someone has spoken to you through your dreams,
deliberately leading you to secrets that have been hidden here for so long. But
why? There must be a reason for all of this.

>get plates
You take the plates with you.

southwest and to the north.

>examine altar
You approach the ancient altar in awe. The stone structure is weathered and
worn, its edges smoothed by countless hands over the centuries. As you get
closer, you notice that the altar is decorated with elaborate carvings of
biblical scenes and symbols. There is a depiction of the last supper, with Jesus
and his disciples gathered around a table, and an image of the crucifixion, with
Jesus on the cross and Virgin Mary weeping at his feet. On the back of the altar
you notice a bronze panel.

>examine panel
The panel depicts the chaotic events of the end of the world. The Four Horsemen
ride through the sky, their steeds galloping at breakneck speed. This scene is
explicitly described in the Book of Revelation. The first horseman rides a white
horse, symbolising conquest, while the second rides a red horse, symbolising
war. The third horseman rides a black horse, representing famine, and the last
horseman rides a pale horse, representing death. A closer look at the panel
reveals that the sky behind the horsemen is ablaze with fire and brimstone, and
the ground is littered with the bodies of the damned. The scene is filled with
vivid detail, from the writhing souls of the damned to the triumphant
expressions on the faces of the saved. There is a spot with an indentation in
the panel where something seems to be missing. The indentation has the shape of
a humanoid silhouette.

>put statuette in panel
You put the statuette in the bronze panel and it fits perfectly. The next
moment, a hidden mechanism activates and the altar slides backwards, revealing
an opening below that leads into the blackest darkness.

>turn on torch
You switch the electric torch on.

>d
Slowly you descend until you are completely engulfed in darkness.

Undercroft
Your electric torch illuminates imposing and grand architecture, with soaring
arches and vaulted ceilings. In the dim light, you can make out old tapestries
hanging from the walls, faded and tattered with time, depicting battles and
heroic deeds. In one corner you see an ancient suit of armour, its once shining
metal now covered in rust and cobwebs. You can almost hear the ghostly clanking
of its joints as it marches off to war. Stone steps lead up. A door leads
northeast.

>ne

Crypt
You can barely make out the outlines of several stone coffins, neatly arranged
in rows around the perimeter of the room, strikingly not decorated or inscribed.
One coffin has been opened, revealing the remains of an ancient shroud and the
faint outline of bones. To the south is a large door leading back to the
undercroft. On one side of the crypt are several murals depicting a monastery,
an island, an abbey and a church.

>put nathalan plate in tullich mural
You put the Saint Nathalan plate into the church mural.

>put adomnan plate in iona mural
You put the Saint Adomnan plate into the abbey mural.

>put kessog plate in inchtavannach mural
You put the Saint Kessog plate into the island mural.

>put cuthbert plate in lindisfarne mural
You put the Saint Cuthbert plate into the monastery mural.

A click can be heard behind you. On the outside of the ransacked coffin a secret
compartment has opened. Inside you notice an amulet.

>get amulet
You take the opaque amulet with you.

>examine it
Something about it fills you with awe, though you can't quite put your finger on
it. Tied to an old leather cord, you recognise what at first glance could be
molten glass. It has a greenish shimmer and is opaque. You have seen something
like this before. It looks to you like trinitite, the glassy residue left on the
desert floor after the plutonium-based Trinity bomb test in New Mexico back in
1945. Only extremely high temperatures can melt sand into trinitite.

However, the leather cord does not fit the chronology. The Trinity bomb was
detonated in 1945 and the leather looks very old. The fact that the amulet has
been hidden here for many centuries also does not support your theory. You
should try to find out more about the amulet. Perhaps there are records of it
here in Blackwood? That would be obvious.

books of all shapes and sizes. Many of their bindings seem faded with time. The
shelves themselves are made of dark, polished wood and have a warm, inviting
feel to them. The air is thick with the scent of leather and old paper. A large
wooden table is covered with old manuscripts and parchments. The vestibule lies
southwards.

>x books
You notice that many of these works, due to their age, are written in Latin.
Fortunately, Latin, which was the language of the Church in early Britain, was
taught to you at school. Many people are not aware that the church conducted all
services in Latin, and the Bible was known in Western Europe in the Latin
Vulgate translation produced by Saint Jerome in the late fourth century. As a
result, Latin was regarded as one of the three sacred languages (along with
Greek and Hebrew). Amazing when you consider that the language of Jesus Christ
was Aramaic.

>search books
After a few hours of searching, you find a clue that tells you more about the
amulet. In a book about the saints of Scotland and Northumbria, you discover a
drawing of Saint Cuthbert, probably the most famous saint of early Britain. In
this drawing you can see that he is wearing the amulet. Legend has it that the
stone came from Golgotha. At the very moment Jesus Christ died, lightning struck
the earth and created what you suspected to be trinitite. It reflects a moment
when a bridge was built between the world of the living and the world of the
dead.

The amulet is said to have enabled its bearer to communicate with those who
passed on to the other side. It is not recorded how the relic came to
Northumbria, but it is said Cuthbert used it to speak to dead saints and
martyrs. After Cuthbert's death the amulet vanished from history and was never
seen again. Many scholars have therefore assumed that it was a metaphor and not
a real object, which you now believe had been brought to the Blackwood
Monastery.

As you are about to leave, you hear a distant voice calling out to you. The
voice seems to be coming from the garden, but somehow it seems so far away.
Farther than you could ever be. Beyond the realms of existence.

Chronology of the Great Scottish Witch Hunts from 1590 to 1662. The book looks
quite old and very likely belongs to the manor's library. A rather sombre read.

>search chronology
Oh, that's interesting. Lord Bain, the man with the scar, was responsible for
wiping out an entire settlement near Blackwood Manor during the great Scottish
Witch Hunt of 1597. That's in line with what Rosie told you. According to the
records, the inhabitants of this settlement were said to have made a pact with
the devil himself. This is nonsense, of course, but unfortunately people have
done terrible things in the name of the church throughout history. What a sad
story. On a map you can even see that the settlement was in the nearby forest.
You should now be able to find it if there is anything left of it.

The area is lit by a few small windows with thick wooden frames that allow just

>talk to woman
You: "What's your name? What are you doing here?"
She seems to be filled with infinite sadness. Without knowing her fate, you feel
very sorry for her.
Ysabella: "My name is Ysabella. I am waiting for my son to return."

You: "Your son? What happenend?"
Ysabella: "Lord Bain's henchmen brought him to the manor after burning down our
village. They wanted to purge the evil from him. What evil you may ask yourself?
There was no evil in him. He was just a boy and did nothing wrong. When they
were done with him, they buried him next to me, here on this forgotten ground.
But his spirit seems to be trapped in Blackwood Manor, as if something is
preventing him from leaving. And so I wait for him. Desperately. Together we can
leave this place and step into the light but I don't want to let go until I have
my little boy back. How can people be so cruel? Doesn't the Bible teach you to
love your neighbour as yourself?"
She sobs and shakes her head.

What you are about to ask breaks your heart.
You: "Are you aware that you have been waiting here for almost 400 years?"
Ysabella: "Has it been that long? I don't know. I no longer have any sense of
time. Maybe it was that long? Was it? Oh no."

You: "So Lord Bain did this to you?"
Ysabella: "To do God's will. He said an angel had appeared to him and ordered
him to destroy our village, all of us, to prevent the reversal of God's
creation. Evil would walk among us and it would open the gates of chaos if he
wouldn't prevent this from happening. If you ask me, what appeared to him was
certainly no angel. Maybe he was just mad."

You: "I am so sorry to hear this. What can I do to help you?"
Ysabella: "You have access to the manor. There is a secret dungeon in Blackwood
where my boy must be trapped. As I already said, something prevents him from
leaving. Find out what it is. Look for something unusual in the dungeon itself.
You can reach the dungeon from the undercroft underneath the chapel. There is a
stone with a signet. When you push it, a secret passage should open. After my
son has been freed, we must also perform a ritual here on this graveyard that
will lead him the way back to me. It will be his guiding light."

You: "What is needed for this ritual?"
Ysabella: "For the guiding light ritual you need fire, something for the living,
something for the dead and the blood of an innocent."
Ysabella looks at you and notices that you're confused.

You: "What do you mean with "fire"?"
Ysabella: "A few lit candles on my son's gravestone will do."

You: "What do you mean with "something for the living"?"
Ysabella: "You'll need an item that keeps the living alive, a loaf of bread for
example."

You: "What do you mean with "something for the dead"?"
Ysabella: "You are looking for an item that helps the sick and dying transition
into the light. It could be oil for the final anointing or frankincense. You
should find that somewhere in the chapel."

You: "I hope "blood of an innocent" doesn't mean what I think it means."
Ysabella: "You need blood from a noble soul. Your wife seems to be a kind-
hearted person. Ask her if she can give you a few drops of her blood. No one has
to die for fulfilling this part of the ritual. It's a ritual of love."

As you enter, you see Rosie and Cora waiting for you. Rosie seems very agitated,
but Cora is as calm as ever.

Rosie: Sir Thomas, thank God you're here at last. I have been so worried about
you since you called me and asked about Lord Bain. I don't know how to explain,
but I'm sure you've noticed that Blackwood is an unusual place, where long
forgotten secrets lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they reveal themselves and draw
you into a thicket of dark fates and unfulfilled dreams. This is happening to
you right now, isn't it?
You nod without commenting further. In fact, a lot has happened in the last few
hours that has fundamentally turned your world view upside down.

Rosie: It's not the first time someone in Blackwood has been through what you're
going through. Most of the time it didn't end well. There is a story of a groom
who worked here over two hundred years ago. He said the forest called his name.
One night he went home and killed his wife and his daughters with an axe. With
their blood he wrote on the wall: "He is here!" before hanging himself from a
weeping willow in the garden. And don't forget Lord Bain, who was so mad he
thought an angel was speaking to him. At his behest, he slaughtered an entire
village not far from here. I am really worried, so I wanted to offer Lady Cora
to accompany me home until you have done what you have to do here. Would that be
okay for you?

[You now have the choice to let your wife Cora go with Rosie. Do support Cora
leaving with Rosie? Please answer YES or NO.]
no
You: Thank you, Rosie, but I don't think that's necessary.
Rosie: I understand. You're probably right and I'm most likely just getting
carried away.

Rosie bows and then leaves, noticeably worried.

Cora: What is this all about?
You: Strictly speaking, Rosie is right. There is something going on here that I
can't explain. I want you to be safe but for some reason my gut told me it's not
a good idea to go with Rosie. Instead I want you to take your car and drive to
your sister in Inverness. Please trust me.
Cora: Of course I trust you. I'll take the car. When all this is over you better
have a pretty good excuse why there's a goddamn hole in the floor of the chapel.
I love you!

Cora waves to you and leaves the manor alone. Now you are on your own in...

The Chapel
Rows of pews stretch out before you. The occasional creak of old wood can be
heard. An ancient altar is the centrepiece of the chapel, drawing your eyes to
it with its grandeur and attention to detail. Behind it, you see niches with
stained glass windows. One wonders how many prayers and moments of reflection
the chapel has witnessed over the centuries. Doors lead to the south, the
southwest and to the north.

An opening that was hidden below the altar leads down to a very dark place.

You feel dark energy, as if the claustrophobic room is alive with malevolence. A
wooden table, covered in a macabre array of torture tools, glows ominously in
the light of your electric torch. The stains which you suspect to be dry blood
that mar the surface of the table, hint at the unspeakable horrors that have
taken place here. A cell door to the west leads back to the passage.

Someone spilled a line of white crystalline powder in front of the cell door.

The ghost of a little boy is here. He looks at you with uncertainty and deep
sadness.

>examine boy
As you study the apparition, you discern the boy's visage, frozen in eternal
youth. His features bear a sense of innocence, yet there is a haunting sadness
etched into his translucent countenance. His eyes, wide and doe-like, hold a
glimmer of unshed tears, reflecting the torment he endured in life's cruel
grasp. His bare feet hover just above the stone floor, as if reluctant to touch
the cold ground that once held him captive. In his presence, the air grows heavy
with a bittersweet aura, as if the weight of his unfulfilled dreams and
unfinished journey permeates the very atmosphere, yearning for release from the
confines of this desolate dungeon and the torments that bound him here. But
there is also something you can't quite grasp. Somehow you feel uncomfortable
around him.

>talk to boy
You: "Hey, I am Thomas, I am here to help you getting out of this dungeon. Your
mother sent me."
The boy: "Mother? I miss her so much."
He looks sad. But his eyes... you feel cold shivers running down your spine as
they follow you.

You've run out of topics to talk about and end the conversation.

>examine powder
You've read about this in one of the books here in Blackwood. Salt can stop
ghosts and evil entities from entering a room if one simply spills a line of it
in front of all entry points, like windows or doors. It can also be poured or
spilled into a circle around a victim to create an area of protection that keeps
spirits from attacking. A ghost can also be encircled by salt to prevent it from
escaping, much like a devil's trap.

The fireplace, once the main source of heat and cooking, has been replaced by a
modern cooker, but the original mantelpiece and hearth remain as a reminder of
the roaring fire that once burned here. Heavy flagstone floors show the wear and
tear of years of use. Rough-hewn stone worktops add to the old-world charm of
the kitchen, while electric lights brighten the room. There are exits to the
north, south, east and west.

>e

Pantry
Tall shelves run from the floor to the ceiling, lined with jars and baskets
filled with food. On the left-hand side of the room, a commercial fridge stands
tall. To the right is a long wooden table covered with an array of breads. There
are traditional Scottish oatcakes, crusty baguettes and loaves of sourdough
bread that Rosie made before leaving for her Christmas holiday. A door to the
west leads back to the kitchen.

Vestibule
The room is dimly lit by bulbs in sconces, casting long shadows across the cold
floor. To the west, you can see an enormous wooden door leading to the outside,
its surface polished by centuries of use. The library lies to the north, the
great hall to the south and the kitchen to the east. To the southwest, you
notice an old hinged door. A stone staircase spirals upwards.

You notice a few drops of your blood on the ground.

>wipe blood with fabric
You wipe the blood with the linen fabric.

>w

Forecourt
The forecourt is surrounded by a dry stone wall. You hear the sound of a nearby
stream as it meanders through the snowy, lush landscape of the surrounding
forest. Walls of rough-hewn stone loom before you, covered with moss and ivy
with a massive wooden door with iron hinges to the east set into it. Nearby, a
weathered stone bench overlooks a small pond with a stone bridge, leading
northeast to a feral garden. The air is cool and damp.

Feral Garden
You're' admidst barren, snow-covered thornbushes and frost-covered grass. Vines
and thorny brambles creep up the walls of the manor. To the west is an old
dovecote, its structure weathered but still standing. A trail northwards leads
into the forest, disappearing into the shadows of the trees. You can hear the
crunch of snow under your feet and the distant wail of the wind. The scent of
the winter air fills your senses with the crisp, refreshing aroma of the season.
A cobbled path leads southwest.

>w

Dovecote
The dovecote has been repurposed as a garden shed. The inside is cluttered with
garden tools, bags of soil and pots of various sizes. You can see that the
nesting holes have been blocked off, but the faint scent of bird droppings still
lingers in the air. A door to the east leads back to the garden.

In the center of the dovecote, you behold the spectral figure of a medieval
Scottish lord, his presence commanding attention even in his ethereal form. It
is Lord Bain, slayer in the name of God.

>x bain
Dressed in regal attire befitting his noble station, the spirit stands tall and
proud. His tattered yet ornate tartan kilt drapes around his legs and a
weathered sporran hangs from his waist. A faded and moth-eaten velvet doublet
adorns his torso, its once vibrant colours now faded with the passing centuries.
The Lord's ghostly visage exudes an aura of wisdom and authority. His face,
though partially obscured by the veil of time, bears the weathered lines of a
life well lived, etched with both hardship and triumph. Deep-set eyes, their
piercing gaze still undimmed, survey the dovecote with a mixture of solemnity
and longing.

>talk to bain
You: Lord Bain?
Lord Bain: I think that was my name once upon a time. Whatever you want from me,
I probably won't be able to help you. I have to admit that my memory has faded.
I wish I could remember why I'm still here.

>give chronology to him
You show Lord Bain the chronology. He looks at you thoughtfully, then nods
sadly.
Lord Bain: I remember. You probably think I'm pure evil, but I assure you I'm
not. I have seen the true evil.
You: The boy?

Lord Bain: The Lord of Lies speaks with a seductive tongue and appears dressed
in the cloak of innocence. Whatever he or his followers want from you, trust no
one. He may look like a boy but he is Lucifer's offspring. With the help of a
Saint we were able to separate his body from his evil mind and trap him inside
Blackwood's dungeon. If you want to ban him from the face of the earth, you need
to reunite his dark consciousness with his flesh and then destroy the source of
his power.
You: Why didn't you do that back then?

Lord Bain: The saint was very clear in his instructions about what we have to
do. He said there would come a time many moons later when the unholy child would
be defeated once and for all. Since then I have been waiting in this limbo for
that day to come.
You: I see. And what about his source of power?

Lord Bain: The villagers used a forbidden book to conceive the child with
Lucifer. It is possible that the Light Bearer even lived in this village for a
while. We do not know. What we did find out was that the father of the unholy
child died during conception. His mother allegedly lived in the village, but we
never found her. That's confusing, isn't it?
You: Not if you are open to the theory that Lucifer could be female.

Lord Bain: That's an interesting theory. We never took that into consideration.
You: I think I know everything I need to know now. I will search for this book
and try to destroy it at the right time. Thank you, Lord Bain.

Lord Bain: Farewell my son. Remember what your eyes can't see, your ears might
hear.
You nod and then turn away from him.

Forest Trail
Snow-covered trees tower above you, their branches creaking and swaying in the
frigid wind. The trail ahead of you is barely visible, winding its way further
northwest through the thick undergrowth and disappearing into the dense flora of
the woods. The trail is narrow, flanked on either side by a wall of gnarled
trees and prickly bushes, their leafless branches stretching out like skeletal
fingers. It's very quiet except for the occasional rustle of a small animal
darting through the underbrush. Further south, the path leads back to the feral
garden of Blackwood Manor.

>nw

Ruins
You see the ruins of a small village, ancient and weathered, covered in a thick
layer of snow and ice. The masonry is crumbling, the arches distorted and
twisted by years of decay. The village must have been abandoned centuries ago.
Strange shapes and shadows lurk in the corners of your vision, making you wonder
if you're really alone in this place. The trail heads north and southeast from
here.

>listen
You hold your breath and listen to distant howling of the wind. Then you hear
it. A bloodcurdling whisper, spoken in a demonic tongue, leads you to the cellar
entrance. The rotten door set into the ground slams into the darkness as you
pull to open it.

A cellar entrance leads further down into the blackest darkness.

>d
You slowly descend to the darkest place you've ever been to.

In the dark
You are surrounded by darkness. Some nastiness might drag you into the depths of
hell.

>turn on torch
You switch the electric torch on.

Cellar
The musty air is thick with the smell of decay as the dim light of your electric
torch reveals cobwebbed corners and forgotten debris. Somebody etched strange
symbols into the walls. Old wooden barrels and rusted tools are scattered about
the cellar floor. You can hear whispers, but you can't make out what they're
saying. It could be a language you've never heard before. Narrow, creaky stairs
lead up to the ruins of the abandoned village.

In a corner is a dark alcove where a mysterious ancient tome glimmers in the
light of your torch.

>examine tome
The title is "De Vermis Mysteriis". It seems to be written partly in Latin and
partly in a runic language you don't know. In fact, you have heard of this book.
It was written by Ludvig Prinn, a Belgian necromancer who was captured and
executed for heresy during the 9th Crusade in 1271. The book was based on rites
and incantations that Prinn learned from Shaitan cultists in ancient Syria.
There were a few transcripts, but they are said to be all destroyed by the
church. Could this be Prinn's original book?

>get tome
You take the ancient tome with you.

You turn off your electric torch to conserve battery power.

Overgrown Graveyard
The winter sun casts a pale light over the gravestones, some standing upright
and others toppled over. Ivy vines creep over the once sturdy frame of the
rusted entrance gate. The silence is so complete that you can hear your own
breathing, and every footstep you take seems to echo through the stillness. From
here, you can only head south and return to the ruins.

You encounter the ethereal presence of a medieval ghost woman, standing admidst
the graves.

>talk to ysabella
She looks at you expectantly.
Ysabella: Are you ready for the ritual?
yes

Ysabella: Come here and put the candles on the gravestone.
Ysabella floats to a gravestone that has no name on it.

>examine gravestone
Its surface is etched with sinister markings that evoke a sense of unease. The
absence of a name adds to the unsettling aura, leaving whispered questions
unanswered. Time has not been kind, as cracks and erosion mar the gravestone,
reflecting the decay of forgotten memories.

>put candles on gravestone
You put the set of candles on the gravestone.

>flick lighter
You light up the lighter.

>light candles with lighter
You light the candles on the gravestone.
Ysabella: Veni ignis, ilumina viam impiorum!

Ysabella now levitates over the grave, moving her arms in an incantatory
gesture. The snow begins to melt. You can barely believe your eyes as you
witness the earth shifting to uncover a medieval lead coffin. As if by magic,
the lid opens to reveal the dead body of the boy whose ghost you saw in the
dungeon. Horrified, you realise that he shows no signs of decomposition. In
fact, he looks as if he is peacefully asleep. A cold shiver runs down your
spine.

Ysabella: now place something for the living in the coffin.

>put bread in coffin
You put the bread in the lead coffin.
Ysabella: Auferte panem a discipulis Nazareni! Transibunt plagae terram suam!

She raises her hands in an almost threatening gesture. Then she smiles at you. A
smile that somehow seems false.
Ysabella: Now something for the dead, Thomas.

Ouch, the lighter became too hot in your hands and is now unlit.

>put incense in lighter
The lighter either can't contain any things or you shouldn't worry about it.

>put incense in coffin
You use the lighter to make the frankincense smoulder, then you place it in the
coffin.
Ysabella: Aperi portas inferi mortuorum. Ultimus Saturnus hac nocte fulgebit in
firmamento, clarior sidus in odio Bethleem. Adventum tenebrarum incarnati
praedicabit!

Ysabella: And now the blood of an innocent.

>put fabric in coffin
You put the bloody linen fabric into the coffin and the boy inside starts to
breathe. Mew life seems to flow into the dead body. How is that possible?

Ysabella mumbles something. She still seems to be busy with the ritual.

[You can now WAIT for Ysabella to finish the ritual. Alternatively, you can try
to intervene, if that is what you want. What will you do?]

>pour salt in coffin
You pour the salt into the leadcoffin. The thing inside, which you are now
certain is not human, twitches and writhes in pain as bloodcurdling screams
alternate with guttural cries, more demonic and evil than anything you have ever
heard. The eyes are fixed on you, vicious and hateful, not the eyes of a child,
but those of a reptile. Like twin orbs of malevolence, they flicker with an
otherworldly intensity, possessing an unsettling depth, as if peering into them
could reveal the darkest secrets of the universe.

The irises, a chilling shade of crimson, seem to pulsate with an ominous energy
that sends a shiver down your spine. Within those crimson irises, you can
discern a twisted reflection of your own fears and doubts, distorted and
amplified. It's as if these eyes, which you understand now can only be the eyes
of the Antichrist, have the power to see through your very soul, exposing your
vulnerabilities and exploiting them for sinister purposes.

As you try to look away, you notice the faintest hint of a maleficent spark,
like dying embers of a wicked flame, conveying a sense of ancient knowledge, an
awareness of the secrets that lie beyond mortal comprehension. In these depths,
you can almost perceive the echoes of countless souls who have fallen under the
Antichrist's sway.

Ysabella yells at you: No! Why did you do that?

Suddenly, a low howl begins to rise, growing in intensity. A strong wind whips
through the ancient graveyard, rustling the tangled branches of the surrounding
forest. The wind carries a haunting melody, as if a thousand voices cry in pain.

[You feel that something is about to happen and your next move has to be a good
one.]

>burn tome with candles
Within a second, the ancient tome catches fire. Startled by the intensity of the
flames, you drop it on the ground.

The Antichrist's haunting screams ceased the very moment the ancient tome began
to burn. Then you realise why. Wisps of smoke rise from the lead coffin,
twisting and curling as if driven by an otherworldly force. A haunting wind
howls through the graveyard, carrying with it the scent of burning flesh, a
faint, unsettling odor. You approach the coffin and your heart races as you
observe the macabre scene inside. The unholy boy's features are twisted in an
expression of eternal torment. Flames dance mercilessly across his form, leaping
in a grotesque ballet, consuming what little is left of his earthly vessel. His
eyes, empty sockets now, seem to pierce through the veil between worlds, staring
into the evil void from which he came.

You turn slowly and Ysabella stands before you. Her eyes, pools of darkness,
seem to hold both the weight of forgotten ages and the fire of a thousand stars.
Time bends around her, and with a single heartbeat, the world transforms. The
air grows even colder, and the icy breeze cuts with rage through the graveyard,
carrying with it a mournful symphony of whispers and sighs. Before your very
eyes, Ysabella shifts and twists into a portrait of malice, a visage that echoes
the primordial terror of mankind's deepest nightmares. Gone is the semblance of
elegance. The pure evil that emanates from her is palpable, a noxious miasma
that curls and coils around your senses, a suffocating embrace that fills the
air with impending doom.

It is then, in that chilling moment, that realization dawns like a jagged
lightning bolt. The woman before you is not merely a specter of the past, nor a
mere haunt of this forsaken ground. No, she is something far more ancient, far
more insidious. Lucifer, the Morning Star, the embodiment of all that is
forbidden and accursed. Her lips part, and a sound emerges, a voice that seems
to reverberate not only in the confines of your mind but also in the very marrow
of your bones.

Lucifer: You will regret this.
She hisses, her words both a venomous caress and a sinister threat that echoes
through the forest. A brief interlude that seems to last for aeons until she
vanishes before you.

And then you see him. The ghost of an old man who apparently watched your
confrontation with Lucifer and her offspring, bathed in a faint, ethereal glow,
emerging from the halo above his head.

Cuthbert: You have done well, my son. I am Cuthbert of Lindisfarne.
You: I have so many questions.

Cuthbert: And I'm afraid I don't have many answers, nor can I linger here for
long. Everything happened as it had to happen, both then and now.
He extends a hand towards you.
Cuthbert: I'll take the amulet with me. It has served its purpose.

You: Oh, the amulet. I understand that I had to find it in order to speak to
Lord Bain. Without it, I'm sure I would have made a terrible mistake. But why
did Lucifer want me to wear it here too?
Cuthbert: The Morning Star is a master of deception. In fact, the amulet was
also an important component of her unholy ritual. Only a thin veil separates
this world from other planes of existence. And the amulet is a key to look
behind it. She would have used it to open the gates of hell and plunge the world
into chaos forever.
You shiver as you think about it.

So you remove the amulet and you hold it in your hand for a moment, where it
sparkles as it reflects the light of the winter sun. Just a blink of an eye and
then everything is gone. The amulet, Cuthbert, the coffin, even the charred
remains of the unholy tome.

As you make your way home, the day begins to fade towards dusk and a sense of
calm settles in. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows on the landscape.
When you reach the manor's feral garden, the sun inches close to the horizon and
bathes the grounds of Blackwood in a warm glow of gold and amber. Snow-capped
hills and valleys create a serene panorama, a world untouched by the darkness
that had threatened it.
