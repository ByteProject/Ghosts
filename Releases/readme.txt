The Ghosts of Blackwood Manor is an award-winning interactive horror from Stefan Vogt, the acclaimed author of Hibernated and The Curse of Rabenstein.

Take on the role of novelist Thomas King and his wife Cora as they move into a remote Scottish Manor house, just days before Christmas 1986. Seeking inspiration for his next book, Thomas begins to explore the history of Blackwood Manor, only to uncover a dark secret that dates back centuries to the days of the Great Scottish Witch Hunts.

The Ghosts of Blackwood Manor is a complex interactive fiction piece written in Infocom's advanced Z-machine format XZIP. The game has three different endings, a bad, a neutral and a good ending, depending on the player's choices. It is very likely that the player, on a first playthrough, will not reach the good ending, even though it is possible. Reaching the bad or neutral ending first is part of the experience and helps the player understanding the true intentions of some of the NPCs and the impact of decisions made, so they may be reconsidered.

SYSTEMS
The game is available for Commodore 64, Spectrum +3, Spectrum Next, Amstrad CPC and PCW, Commodore Amiga, Atari 8-bit, Apple II, Atari ST, MS-DOS, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Commodore 128, Mega65, MSX 1 and MSX 2, Commodore Plus/4, SAM Coupé, TRS-80 Model III, TRS-80 Model 4, classic Macintosh and modern PC. For playing the game on a modern machine, a .z5 file is provided, which allows you to run the game in a Z-machine interpreter of choice like Frotz, Lectrote or Fizmo.

PHYSICAL RELEASE
A physical release will soon be available and it comes in a box that resembles the original Infocom packaging back from the day. You will be able to pre-order it through my publisher PolyPlay. I will update this section once the pre-order is live.

DONATIONS
It took me almost a year to create Ghosts, so any donation is much appreciated. It helps me to continue writing new games for the retro community. Don't worry though if you can't afford to donate something. Just proceed to the downloads and enjoy.

TEXT ADVENTURES IN THE MODERN ERA
The Ghosts of Blackwood Manor is following the path of some of the most iconic interactive fiction works from the 80s and early 90s, trying to resemble a retro look and feel but it also aims to meet modern era expectations. There are no dead ends and the diffculty level is moderate. Generally it's more about experiencing a story rather than drowning the player in frustration.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
You'll find a PlayIF card in this archive which also has been printed on a postcard for the physical release. This is your introduction to interactive fiction gameplay. The game makes use of a few additional verbs but it is very verbose in telling you what these are and how they are applied correctly. When the game starts, you are prompted to type HELP. Please do so at least once to learn about the specific game mechanics.

Special thanks to my buddy Shawn Sijnstra who heard my cry of distress and created the Z-Machine interpreter VEZZA so that this game could be enjoyed on way more systems than I initially thought I could target. If you find your beloved childhood computer in the list above, there is a pretty good chance that Shawn made it possible. He's a rockstar!

This game has been written using Graham Nelson's Inform 6 language, words can hardly express his gift to the community. It uses PunyInform, an alternate library by Fredrik Ramsberg and Johan Berntsson, optimized for classic 8-bit and 16-bit targets. Without the hard work and support of these individuals, none of this would have ever been possible. I'd also like to thank Infocom for being a constant inspiration since my youth and for creating the Z-machine standard, allowing us to still honor their heritage so many years after they disbanded. I played many Infocom games on my beloved Commodore Amiga and now after more than 30 years I can neither forget nor let go. My deepest appreciation goes to Andrew Plotkin, whether it's for his work on the PlayIF card that comes with this game, the MaxZip interpreter that's been used for the classic Macintosh version or for helping us with feature requests and bugfixes on the current Inform compiler. Thanks to my friend Uto for the MSX loader, my buddy aka lab assistant "The Geek" aka ZZAP!64 editor in crime Christian Simpson aka Perfractic for all his support on his channel, again Fredrik and Johan for their amazing Ozmoo interpreter that is used for the C64, C128, Plus/4 and Mega65 versions of this game, Steve Flintham for his outstanding work in porting Ozmoo to the BBC and the Elk, the one and only George Beckett for igniting my Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3 love but also for his incredible work with ZXLDR on the CP/M Plus .SCR renderer and of course for connecting me to the copyright holder of Locomotive CP/M Plus, allowing us to bundle it with the game, Henrik Åsman for powerful ZAbbrevMaker, Juan J. Martínez for the CPC loader code and the dumpal utility, Chris Pile for his work on Pro-DOS, Jindroush for his amazing Atari 8-bit interpreters.

If you feel that you have been forgotten here, please bear with me. It did not happen intentionally. The work of countless individuals made this game possible and the term "countless" generally does not work well with my brain as I get older. Give me a nudge and I'll add you here to the golden hall of heroes.
